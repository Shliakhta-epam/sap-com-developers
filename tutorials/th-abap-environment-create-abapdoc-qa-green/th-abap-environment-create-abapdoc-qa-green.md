[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Open ABAP class)]
First, open the ABAP class **`ZCL_AMDP_DEMO_XXX`** from the tutorial [Create an AMDP and Analyze Its Performance](abap-environment-amdp-profiling)

!![Image depicting step-1-open-class](step-1-open-class.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create ABAPDoc comment)]
1. Immediately before the class definition, add an ABAPDoc comment to the class by entering **`"!`** and choosing **Auto-complete ( `Ctrl+Space` )**.

2. From the dropdown list, choose **Paragraph**, then add the following comment:

    **`"!<p>Class tests AMDP</p>`**

    !![step2a-choose-paragraph](step2a-choose-paragraph.png)

    >You must insert the ABAPDoc comment **immediately** before the declaration; otherwise you will get a warning from ADT.

3. Add the following to the paragraph ( `<p>` ) tag: **`class="shorttext synchronized"`**, so your code looks like this:

    ```
    "!<p class="shorttext synchronized">Class tests AMDP: </p>
    ```

4. Add the following comments to the table type **`ty_result_line`** and to the method **`GET_FLIGHTS`** respectively:

    ```
    "!<p class="shorttext synchronized">Table type of Flights from HANA DB</p>
    "! <p class="shorttext synchronized"> Method reads flights from HANA DB using AMDP</p>
    ```

5. Save and activate your class.

The comments should now appear in the Outline View:

!![step2b-shorttext-synch-class](step2b-shorttext-synch-class.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add sorted list)]
1. Choose **Enter**. The system automatically inserts the ABAPDoc comments annotation `"!"` for you.

2. Again, choose **Auto-complete ( `Ctrl+Space` )**. Then choose **Sorted list**.

    !![step3a-add-sorted-list](step3a-add-sorted-list.png)

3. Add the following two statements, so that your code looks like this:

    ```
    "! <ol>
    "!    <li>Reads flights from HANA DB</li>
    "!    <li>Converts currency to EUR</li>
    "! </ol>

    ```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Add link)]
1. Immediately after the sorted list, choose **Enter**.

2. Now enter the following comment:

    **`"! <p>Implements the interface { @link INTF: if_oo_adt_classrun } </p>`**

This creates a link to the Element information for that interface.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
